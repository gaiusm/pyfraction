This project forks the fraction modules from the pge project.

The fraction code base dates back to 2010 and is used by pge to populate
its game engine world.  This project adds a Python3 interface to
the Modula-2 fraction module.  The Modula-2 code base handles all the
fraction arithmetic and also the garbage collection.

Version 0.1  The initial checkin.
